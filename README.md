# Flutter_Challenges
Here are some challenges I have completed while completing the Flutter Development course by Dr.Angela Yu (https://www.udemy.com/course/flutter-bootcamp-with-dart/)

1) Magic-8-ball:
It is a decision-making app which on every tap we get a new answer. From this, the stateless and stateful widget concepts of flutter can be clearly understood.

2) Destini:
It is an app where there will be several stories, and each story will continue in different paths depending on the user's choice.

2) Flash Chat:
It is a messenger app incorporating Firebase Firestore, which also includes the Firebase authentication package and cloud NoSQL database.
