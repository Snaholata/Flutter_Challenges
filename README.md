# Flutter_Challenges
Here are some challenges I have completed while completing the Flutter Development course by Dr.Angela Yu (https://www.udemy.com/course/flutter-bootcamp-with-dart/)

1) Magic-8-ball:
It is a decision making app which on every tap we get a new answer. From this the stateless and stateful widget concepts of flutter can be clearly understood.

2) Destini:
It is an app where there will be several stories and each story will continue in different paths depending on users choice.
